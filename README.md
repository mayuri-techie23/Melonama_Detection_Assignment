# Melonama Detection> 
Outline a brief description of your project.

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.


The main objective for this project is to build a CNN base model to detect meloname which can evaluate images and alert dermatologist about melanoma presence so that correct treatment can be provided on time.

- What is the background of your project?

Build a CNN based model

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

The main objective is to detect melonama which can evaluate images and alert dermatologist about melanoma presence so that correct treatment can be provided on time.

- What is the dataset that is being used?


Dataset contains different images classified as diseases which are are dangerous or normal.

## Conclusions


1. When we first build the model, it was slightly overfitted.
2. To reduce the loss and increase the accuracy we applied data augmentation technique. Due to this step, there is reduction in loss and overfitting problem was solved.


3. To increase accuracy of model we increased the epoch from 20 to 50. We observed increase in accuracy from 79% to 90%. This implies that model is a good fit. 
4. From this conclusion we can say that model is able to correctly classify the images with 90% accuracy.
